Modularized Design Studies, Demos, and Templates

The "Global" Module contains shared libraries and images as well as the html header and footers.  These are loaded before (header) or after (footer) for all other moduels.

Individual modules only support one of each of the following resources:
* css
* js
* html

Each resource should have the same file name as the folder containing them.
* example_mod
 * example_mod.css
 * example_mod.html
 * example_mod.js
